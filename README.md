NBBC was last [updated officially](http://nbbc.sourceforge.net/) in 2010; this is forked from the best third-party fork we could find.

# Goals:

* Composer support.
* PHP 7 support.
* Integrate into Vanilla Forums as a Composer dependency.

This will deprecate our existing [NBBC addon](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/nbbc-plugin).
